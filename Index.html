  <p id="Introduction">Hello, My name is Ronald Allan C. Gonzales! I study in <a href="https://fareasternprivateschool.ae/" target="_blank"> Far Eastern Private School (FEPS) </a> and am tasked to make a website.... </p>
    <p id="Paragraph1">In this Blog I will be demonstrating the use of both HTML and CSS in the file. This can viewed by launching the .HTML itself from a 3rd party software such as Visual Studios or Sublime. Alternatively, you can also inspect the code in the browser itself through the inspect command. If you aren't interested, you can just open the .HTML file and grade it through the browser.  </p>

     <p id="ChessP">I have been playing chess for a little over 2 years now. I usually play it in the morning as it increases my logical and critical thinking. Chess involves memorization of similar patterns and critical thinking for irregular patterns. Because of the amount of time I played chess for, I was confident enough to represent my team in the Intramurals for the chess competition. It resulted to me being 2nd place but it was overall a great experience.</p>

    <p id="CodingP">If you haven't noticed, this website was created through HTML and CSS only. Although I wanted to incorporate JavaScript (JS) I wasn't confident nor experience enough to try to implement it. Coding is like a puzzle for me as it requires your vast knowledge of tags and elements and creative insight to create a website. However, as of right now, I am still inexperience but I learned alot from this project and it has further advance my skill in both HTML and CSS.</p>
